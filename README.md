## Eye Gaze Tracking
Hello, my name is Jayanti Lahoti and I am a student at BMS College Of Engineering. This project is being carried out in order to track the eye movements. It is capable of detecting when the eye is looking up, down, right, left, and blinking on a roughly symmetrical basis.
### For Pip install
Install these dependencies (NumPy, OpenCV, Dlib):

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> The Dlib library has few prequisties like cmake so you can refer the following link: (https://learnopencv.com/install-dlib-on-windows/) to know how to easily install Dlib.


### Verify Installation

Run the code:

```shell
python main.py
```
## Functions

Functions defined in the main.py:

- get_blinking_ratio 
- get_only_eye 
- get_gaze_ratio_ver 
- get_gaze_ratio_hor
